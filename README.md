# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

The goal of this Challenge was to make a timed, multiple-choice code quiz. I need three different files for this challenge: an HTML file, a Css file, and a Java script file. I made a Css file index for styling the app with Css. a Javascript file as well, so the index can store Gs. I linked the css file to the html file with a link tag and attached the css file to the html file. I also added the javascript file using a script tag. I made another quiz page (called quiz.html), did it twice, and added a bootstrap to it. I used flexbooks for both the div class and the container class. I made a div class that shows each question separately. For the list of questions in the js file, I made an array. Then I made a variable for the timer, and I made a function where the timer will run over and over.I'll turn the class's attention to the question. So i picks the question element. Now inside the question part. I'll show you what the question is. I gave it a bootstrap since each answer is a button.I put the high scores in local storage in the form of Jason. So, when I get good scores, they will also look like Jason, so I change them. I have to break them apart. I made another HTML file and pasted the bootstrap lik into it. Make another java script file and link the html file to it. I styled it with bootstrap.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on coding fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
